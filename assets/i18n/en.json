    "title": "About Daoism and Laozi AI",
    "welcome": "Welcome to {domain}!",
    "platform_description": "{domain} is a platform dedicated to exploring the wisdom of Daoism and the teachings of Laozi. Here, you can interact with an AI representation of Laozi, ask questions about Daoist philosophy, and discover insights from the timeless Tao Te Ching.",
    "laozi_description": "Laozi, the legendary founder of Daoism, is traditionally credited as the author of the Tao Te Ching - a foundational text that emphasizes harmony with the Dao (the Way). Through this app, you can explore his philosophy in a new, interactive way: simply ask Laozi to share the text chapter by chapter, or discuss how its ideas apply to life today.",
    "philosophy_title": "The Philosophy of Daoism",
    "daoism_description": "Daoism (Taoism) is an ancient Chinese philosophy and spiritual tradition centered around living in harmony with the Dao - the natural, spontaneous order of the universe. It encourages compassion, simplicity, and humility, teaching that the highest virtue comes from following the natural flow of life rather than resisting it.",
    "laozi_quote": "Laozi once said:\n\n“Everyone desires something, but it seems I need nothing. My mind is like that of a fool - how empty it feels! Everyone shines with intelligence, but I alone seem dull. I drift on the waves of life, not knowing where I will stop.”",
    "tao_te_ching_warning": "In the Tao Te Ching, Laozi warns that excessive cleverness and rigid laws often lead to disorder: “The more laws and orders are made prominent, the more thieves and robbers there will be.” He advocates returning to simplicity and inner stillness as the path to true wisdom.",
    "core_principles_title": "Core principles of Daoism include:",
    "wu_wei": "Wu wei (無為) — effortless action. Acting in harmony with nature rather than forcing outcomes.",
    "ziran": "Ziran (自然) — naturalness. Living according to one’s true nature, without artificiality or pretense.",
    "three_treasures": "Compassion, frugality, and humility - the “Three Treasures” of Daoist virtue.",
    "yin_yang": "Balance between Yin and Yang - the dynamic unity of opposites within all things.",
    "practices": "Meditation, breathing, and movement practices such as Tai Chi and Qigong — tools to harmonize the body, mind, and spirit.",
    "paradox_humor": "Daoism also embraces paradox and humor. Laozi’s teachings remind us that the Dao cannot truly be named or fully understood - it can only be experienced through harmony and awareness. This humility before the mystery of life is at the heart of Daoist wisdom.",
    "influence": "From its origins in ancient China, Daoism has deeply influenced art, medicine, martial arts, and poetry. Its focus on balance and flow continues to resonate today, inspiring not only spiritual seekers but also scientists, designers, and thinkers around the world.",
    "chatbot_title": "About the Laozi AI Chatbot",
    "chatbot_description": "Laozi AI is a project by software engineer Dmytro Turskyi, created to make ancient wisdom accessible in a conversational and personal way. It’s not meant to replace real spiritual practice, but to inspire curiosity, reflection, and inner calm through dialogue with the philosophy of Daoism.",
    "digital_garden": "In essence, Laozi AI is not just an app - it’s a digital garden for reflection, built at the crossroads of timeless philosophy and modern technology.",
    "eternal_dao_quote": "“The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.” - Laozi"
  },
  "faq_page": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "why_laozi_ai_title": "Why did you create Laozi AI?",
    "why_laozi_ai_p1": "Laozi AI was born from a mix of curiosity, reflection, and a desire to give thoughtful answers to questions that many people - including myself - ask about life, meaning, and belief. Over time, I noticed that people around me often found their spiritual direction in Christianity, but for me, the texts and traditions of Daoism felt far more natural and logical.",
    "why_laozi_ai_p2": "The real spark for the idea came after watching Mike Flanagan’s miniseries \"The Fall of the House of Usher\", where I first heard about the idea of preserving a person’s identity and wisdom through AI. This inspired me to imagine what it would be like if we could \"revive \" Laozi's wisdom to act as a personal tutor, instantly clarifying the abstract and metaphorical concepts of the Tao Te Ching for anyone - whether they are a novice or facing challenging questions.",
    "why_laozi_ai_p3": "At first, I considered building a playful app called “Jeez Christ”, inspired by the common phrase people say when surprised or frustrated - not as a reference to religion, but as a humorous way to make people reflect on how they approach big questions. But I realized I wanted to create something deeper and more genuine.",
    "why_laozi_ai_p4": "That’s how Laozi AI came to life: a space for people to explore Daoist ideas, reflect on timeless wisdom, and have meaningful dialogue with an AI that channels Laozi’s philosophy. It’s not about converting anyone - it’s about inviting calm, curiosity, and perspective into a world that often feels too fast and too certain.",
    "inconsistent_chapters_title": "Why are chapter numbers inconsistent?",
    "inconsistent_chapters_p1": "The inconsistencies in chapter numbering arise because the AI draws on multiple sources for the Tao Te Ching, each with its own way of dividing and numbering the text. Different translations and editions sometimes group verses differently or assign varying numbers to chapters.",
    "inconsistent_chapters_p2": "While it might seem logical to restrict the AI to a single, authoritative “source of truth,” at this stage we’ve found it more beneficial to allow flexibility. Drawing from multiple translations and commentaries helps the AI form more nuanced and expanded answers that reflect the richness and diversity of Daoist thought.",
    "inconsistent_chapters_p3": "This approach may introduce occasional inconsistencies in chapter numbering, but so far it seems to enhance the overall quality and depth of responses. Unless we find that this variety causes more confusion than clarity, we’ll continue to let the AI explore wisdom from more than one source.",
    "more_languages_title": "Will you add more languages?",
    "more_languages_p1": "The web version currently supports only English, but other languages might be added in the future when time allows, as I am currently focused on parenting and a full-time job.",
    "more_languages_p2": "The mobile version already supports English, Ukrainian and Latvian, and there are no plans to add more languages because maintaining accuracy requires fluency and responsibility for potential language mistakes.",
    "more_languages_p3": "In practice, the AI often responds in the same language the user writes in, depending on the AI provider, so users might still get answers in other languages even if the interface is English.",
    "short_answers_title": "Why did Laozi stop answering in the middle of my question?",
    "short_answers_p1": "Sometimes, Laozi AI will give a shorter response or seem to pause before fully addressing your question. This isn’t a mistake - it’s designed to keep the conversation natural and readable, just as a real person might offer a thought, pause, and wait for your reply.",
    "short_answers_p2": "If a response feels cut off or incomplete, simply say ‘please continue’. Laozi AI remembers the context of your conversation and will pick up right where it left off.",
    "short_answers_p3": "For the most authentic experience, try speaking to Laozi as if you were in conversation with a real person. Even the historical Laozi wouldn’t answer every question in a single, endless speech - wisdom often comes one thought at a time.",
    "different_answers_title": "Why are answers different on web and mobile?",
    "different_answers_p1": "Laozi AI uses different AI setups depending on the platform you are using.",
    "different_answers_p2": "The web version includes a retrieval system that leverages website content to provide more context-aware and detailed answers.",
    "different_answers_p3": "On the other hand, the mobile versions rely solely on the AI model’s internal knowledge, which can lead to slightly different or more conversational responses.",
    "gateway_timeout_title": "Why did I get a ‘gateway timeout’ error?",
    "gateway_timeout_p1": "A ‘gateway timeout’ error (504) is a rare issue that can occur if your question is too complex for the AI to answer within the server’s time limit (10 seconds). While we aim to handle all prompts, some very demanding questions can cause this issue.",
    "gateway_timeout_p2": "If you see this error, please try rephrasing your question to be more concise. If you believe the prompt should be supported, we would appreciate it if you would use the ‘Report Bug’ feature. Please include a screenshot of the prompt and the error, as this will help us improve the AI’s performance.",
    "chat_history_title": "Why are my past chat sessions not saved?",
    "chat_history_p1": "Yes, you’re right — the app doesn’t currently save past sessions. That’s quite a complex feature to implement, and honestly, I’m not sure if I’ll ever have the time to add it. Sorry about that.",
    "chat_history_p2": "On the positive side, this simplicity also means that every conversation is completely private. You can ask anything you like, and there’s absolutely no way for me (or anyone else) to see or store those chats. Compared to other apps that require accounts or credentials to sync conversations — which makes them far from truly private — I think this approach offers a nice balance of freedom and anonymity.",
    "slow_responses_title": "Why the responses are so slow?",
    "slow_responses_p1": "Speed depends on internet connection, but mainly on the fact that this app is free and we try to keep it this way, by using free or the cheapest services where possilbe to maintain this project and this approach comes with the expense of the speed of the response.",
    "slow_responses_p2": "I am not looking for sponsor, but if one decides to discuss with me performance improvement colaboration options that I can implement they can contact me by using support page or send an email to dmytro@turskyi.com."
